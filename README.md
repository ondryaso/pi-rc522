# Python RC522 library
pi-rc522 consists of two Python classes for controlling an SPI RFID module "RC522" using Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone Black. You can get this module on AliExpress or Ebay for $3.

Based on [MFRC522-python](https://github.com/mxgxw/MFRC522-python/blob/master/README.md).

Install using pip:
```
pip install pi-rc522
```

Or get source code from Github:
```
git clone https://github.com/ondryaso/pi-rc522.git
cd pi-rc522
python setup.py install
```
You'll also need to install the [**spidev**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/spidev) and [**RPi.GPIO**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO) libraries on Raspberry PI, and [**Adafruit_BBIO**](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python) on Beaglebone Black (which should be installed by default).

[MIFARE datasheet](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF1S50YYX_V1.pdf) can be useful.

## Sectors? Blocks?
Classic 1K MIFARE tag has **16 sectors**, each contains **4 blocks**. Each block has 16 bytes. All this stuff is indexed - you must count from zero. The library uses "**block addresses**", which are positions of blocks - so block address 5 is second block of second sector, thus it's block 1 of sector 1 (indexes). Block addresses 0, 1, 2, 3 are from the first sector - sector 0. Block addresses 4, 5, 6, 7 are from the second sector - sector 1, and so on. You should **not write** to first block - S0B0, because it contains manufacturer data. Each sector has it's **sector trailer**, which is located at it's last block - block 3. This block contains keys and access bits for corresponding sector. For more info, look at page 10 of the datasheet. You can use [this](http://www.proxmark.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=1408) useful utility to calculate access bits.

## Connecting
Connecting RC522 module to SPI is pretty easy. You can use [this neat website](http://pi.gadgetoid.com/pinout) for reference.

| Board pin name | Board pin | Physical RPi pin | RPi pin name | Beaglebone Black pin name |
|----------------|-----------|------------------|--------------| --------------------------|
| SDA            | 1         | 24               | GPIO8, CE0   | P9\_17, SPI0\_CS0         |
| SCK            | 2         | 23               | GPIO11, SCKL | P9\_22, SPI0\_SCLK        |
| MOSI           | 3         | 19               | GPIO10, MOSI | P9\_18, SPI0\_D1          |
| MISO           | 4         | 21               | GPIO9, MISO  | P9\_21, SPI0\_D0          |
| IRQ            | 5         | 18               | GPIO24       | P9\_15, GPIO\_48          |
| GND            | 6         | 6, 9, 20, 25     | Ground       | Ground                    |
| RST            | 7         | 22               | GPIO25       | P9\_23, GPIO\_49          |
| 3.3V           | 8         | 1,17             | 3V3          | VDD\_3V3                  |

You can also connect the SDA pin to CE1 (GPIO7, pin #26) and call the RFID constructor with *bus=0, device=1*
and you can connect RST pin to any other free GPIO pin and call the constructor with *pin_rst=__BOARD numbering pin__*.
Furthermore, the IRQ pin is configurable by passing *pin_irq=__BOARD numbering pin__*.

__NOTE:__ For RPi A+/B+/2/3 with 40 pin connector, SPI1/2 is available on top of SPI0. Kernel 4.4.x or higher and *dtoverlay* configuration is required. For SPI1/2, *pin_ce=__BOARD numbering pin__* is required.

__NOTE:__ On Beaglebone Black, use pin names (e.g. `"P9_17"`).

__NOTE:__ On Beaglebone Black, generally you have to enable the SPI for the spidev device to show up; you can enable SPI0 by doing `echo BB-SPIDEV0 > /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots`. SPI1 is available *only if you disable HDMI*.

You may change BOARD pinout to BCM py passing *pin_mode=RPi.GPIO.BCM*. Please note, that you then have to define all pins (irq+rst, ce if neccessary). Otherwise they would default to perhaps wrong pins (rst to pin 15/GPIO22, irq to pin 12/GPIO18).

## Usage
The library is split to two classes - **RFID** and **RFIDUtil**. You can use only RFID, RFIDUtil just makes life a little bit better.
You basically want to start with *while True* loop and "poll" the tag state. That's done using *request* method. Most of the methods
return error state, which is simple boolean - True is error, False is not error. The *request* method returns True if tag is **not**
present. If request is successful, you should call *anticoll* method. It runs anti-collision algorithms and returns used tag UID, which
you'll use for *select_tag* method. Now you can do whatever you want. Important methods are documented. You can also look at the Read and KeyChange examples for RFIDUtil usage.

```python
from pirc522 import RFID
rdr = RFID()

while True:
  rdr.wait_for_tag()
  (error, tag_type) = rdr.request()
  if not error:
    print("Tag detected")
    (error, uid) = rdr.anticoll()
    if not error:
      print("UID: " + str(uid))
      # Select Tag is required before Auth
      if not rdr.select_tag(uid):
        # Auth for block 10 (block 2 of sector 2) using default shipping key A
        if not rdr.card_auth(rdr.auth_a, 10, [0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF], uid):
          # This will print something like (False, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
          print("Reading block 10: " + str(rdr.read(10)))
          # Always stop crypto1 when done working
          rdr.stop_crypto()

# Calls GPIO cleanup
rdr.cleanup()
```

## Multi_Usage
Polling the tag state in multi RFID Module
*Must* change the ce port the other normal GPIOs
```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from pirc522 import RFID

rdr = RFID()

flag = 0;
rdr.init_multi_ce(pin_ce = [13,15])
try:
    while True:
        if (flag == 0):
            flag = 1
            rdr.switch_init(ce_id=0)
        else:
            flag = 0
            rdr.switch_init(ce_id=1)
        (error, tag_type) = rdr.request()
        if not error:
            print("Tag detected")
            (error, uid) = rdr.anticoll()
            if not error:
                print("UID: " + str(uid))

except Exception, e:
# Calls GPIO cleanup
    print(str(e))
    rdr.cleanup()

```

### Util usage
**RFIDUtil** contains a few useful methods for dealing with tags.

```python
from pirc522 import RFID
import signal
import time

rdr = RFID()
util = rdr.util()
# Set util debug to true - it will print what's going on
util.debug = True

while True:
    # Wait for tag
    rdr.wait_for_tag()

    # Request tag
    (error, data) = rdr.request()
    if not error:
        print("\nDetected")

        (error, uid) = rdr.anticoll()
        if not error:
            # Print UID
            print("Card read UID: "+str(uid[0])+","+str(uid[1])+","+str(uid[2])+","+str(uid[3]))

            # Set tag as used in util. This will call RFID.select_tag(uid)
            util.set_tag(uid)
            # Save authorization info (key B) to util. It doesn't call RFID.card_auth(), that's called when needed
            util.auth(rdr.auth_b, [0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF])
            # Print contents of block 4 in format "S1B0: [contents in decimal]". RFID.card_auth() will be called now
            util.read_out(4)
            # Print it again - now auth won't be called, because it doesn't have to be
            util.read_out(4)
            # Print contents of different block - S1B2 - RFID.card_auth() will be called again
            util.read_out(6)
            # We can change authorization info if you have different key in other sector
            util.auth(rdr.auth_a, [0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF])
            #If you want to use methods from RFID itself, you can use this for authorization
            # This will authorize for block 1 of sector 2 -> block 9
            # This is once more called only if it's not already authorized for this block
            util.do_auth(util.block_addr(2, 1))
            # Now we can do some "lower-level" stuff with block 9
            rdr.write(9, [0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89, 0x98, 0x76, 0x54, 0x32, 0x10, 0x69, 0x27, 0x46, 0x66, 0x66, 0x64])
            # We can rewrite specific bytes in block using this method. None means "don't change this byte"
            # Note that this won't do authorization, because we've already called do_auth for block 9
            util.rewrite(9, [None, None, 0xAB, 0xCD, 0xEF])
            # This will write S2B1: [0x01, 0x23, 0xAB, 0xCD, 0xEF, 0x98, 0x76......] because we've rewritten third, fourth and fifth byte
            util.read_out(9)
            # Let's see what do we have in whole tag
            util.dump()
            # We must stop crypto
            util.deauth()
```
